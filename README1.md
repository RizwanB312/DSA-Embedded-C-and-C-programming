# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice 

## Overview
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice implementations and problem-solving exercises. The goal of this repo is to strengthen core logic, algorithmic thinking, and coding efficiency through regular practice.

It includes solutions written during interview preparation and concept revision.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Searching and Sorting
- Hashing
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (basics)
- Sliding Window & Two Pointer techniques

## Languages Used
- Python
- C / C++
- (add/remove based on your repo)

## Structure
Problems are organized by topic and difficulty where possible.

Example:
arrays/
linked_list/
trees/
dp/

## Purpose
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Practice time and space optimization
- Build algorithmic intuition

## Notes
- Solutions focus on clarity first, then optimization
- Some problems may have multiple approaches
- Practice repository — not production software

## Ongoing Work
This repository is continuously updated as I practice more problems.

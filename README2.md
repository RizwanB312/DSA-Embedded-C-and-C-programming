# Embedded C Practice Programs

## Overview
This repository contains my Embedded C practice programs and low-level coding exercises. It focuses on strengthening fundamentals required for embedded systems programming and hardware-level logic development.

Programs are written for learning and concept validation.

## Topics Covered
- Bitwise operations
- Register-level logic
- Memory handling
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Interrupt concepts (simulated)
- Microcontroller-style logic exercises
- Hardware-oriented control patterns
- Low-level debugging practice

## Concepts Practiced
- Efficient memory usage
- Direct data manipulation
- Timing and control logic
- Structured embedded-style coding

## Tools / Environment
- Standard C compiler
- Simulation environments / practice platforms
- Replit-based execution (if applicable)

## Folder Structure
Programs are grouped by concept or feature where possible.

bitwise/
pointers/
memory/
control_logic/

## Purpose
- Build strong Embedded C fundamentals
- Prepare for embedded/firmware roles
- Practice hardware-near programming style
- Improve low-level debugging ability

## Notes
- Practice-focused implementations
- Some programs simulate embedded behavior
- Educational repository — not hardware-deployed code

## Ongoing Work
More exercises and concept programs will be added regularly.
